 - Now a days we are using the embedded system in many fields to induce the intelligence into the system.This project is about heat monitoring system using the embedded system. In cold countries like europian continent cold is more,so there is necessity of heater in the vehicle to heat the seat.This technology is used to determine the presence of the passenger and if the passenger is present then system starts the functionality. In our project, main aim is monitoring the passenger's existence and Heat the seat and Displaying the heated temperature.
