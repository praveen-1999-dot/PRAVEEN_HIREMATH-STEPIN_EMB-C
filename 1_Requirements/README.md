# Requirements
## Introduction
  Now a days we are using the embedded system in many fields to induce the intelligence into the system.This project is about heat monitoring system using the embedded system.
  In cold countries like europian continent cold is more,so there is necessity of heater in the vehicle to heat the seat.This technology  is used to determine the presence of    the passenger and if the passenger is present  then  system starts the functionality. In our project, main aim  is monitoring the passenger's existence and Heat the seat and Displaying the heated temperature.

## Features
- The system will check whether passenger is seated on the seat or not.
- If seated A, it will sense the temperature,based on that it activates the heater to produce required temperature.
- Driver and the passanger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
- The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display.
- It is best for cold Countries.
- Lower cost and robust system.
- Modula based Approach.

## SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats
### Strengths
- Easy to modify the temperature value.
- The system is robust.
- Low cost.
- Modular Based Programs.
- User Friendly.

### Weakness
-It's only applicable for cold countries.

### Opportunities
-It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners so that it will be helpful in all the countries.

### Threats
-Not suitable for average or high temperature environment.
