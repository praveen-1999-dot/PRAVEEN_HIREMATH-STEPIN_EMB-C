# Requirements
## Introduction
Monitoring is one of the major things of our project. In this technology, it is used to determine the presence of the passenger and if the passenger exists then our system starts the functionality. So nowadays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for new products to make life easier. In our project, the main aim is to design and develop a system that is capable of monitoring the passenger's existence and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

## Features
-  Its capable of determining weather the user is exist or not in the vehicle.
-  If Passanger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication.
-  After the indication it will determine the heat.
-  Driver and the passanger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
-  The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system
-  Modular Based Programming.

## SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats
### Strengths
-  Easy to modify the temperature value.
-  The system is robust.
-  Low cost.
-  Modular Based Programs.
-  User Friendly.

### Weakness
- It's only applicable for the countries which are having having low temperature.

### Opportunities
- It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners so that it will be helpful in all the countries.

### Threats
- Not suitable for average or high temperature environment.
